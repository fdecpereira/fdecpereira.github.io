## Bio

I am currently a professor in the Department of Computing (DCOMP) at the <a href="https://en.ufs.br/pagina/21114" target="_blank">Federal University of Sergipe (UFS)</a>. In my ongoing research, I study combinatorial optimization problems related to the spread of information on social networks. In particular, I work on designing mathematical formulations, exact algorithms and heuristics for the problems I investigate.
